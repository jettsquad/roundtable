/**
 * agenda-verdict.ts — what a host may change on the way to confirming.
 *
 * The rule 1.x drew and 2.0 had let slip: a confirmation confirms a PROPOSAL.
 * `resolveAgenda` used to read `request.agenda ?? team.draft`, so a client
 * could post an agenda nobody had drafted and the team would run it — which
 * makes 「秘书提议、主持人确认」 a description of the happy path rather than a
 * rule.
 *
 * What the host MAY do is edit: retitle a phase, rewrite an instruction,
 * reassign a task, drop a phase. 1.x locked scope/objective/completion
 * against edits because its IR carried a participant snapshot and a goal that
 * a text box had no business rewriting; 2.0's spec carries neither, so there
 * is less to protect and the check is correspondingly smaller — a standing
 * draft, and something left to run.
