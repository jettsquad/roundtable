 * command runs because a person typed it; the registry never submits it to
 * the model, and the result is rendered by the UI without entering model
 * history. The invariant that the host node runs no turns is worth nothing if
 * the surface above it puts an LLM back in the chair.
 *
 * Pure, and tested, because this reads human input: a grammar that silently
 * mis-parses produces a team with the wrong seats and says nothing.
