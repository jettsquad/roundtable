/**
 * mention.ts — pointing at seats by name inside the instruction.
 *
 * 1.x wrote `@高宫望 …` and this project shipped a row of checkboxes instead.
 * The checkboxes are worse for a specific reason: naming someone is part of
 * what you are saying, and splitting it into a separate control means the
 * sentence and its audience are edited in two places and can disagree — you
 * rewrite the question and the ticks stay where they were.
 *
 * Decided against the ACTUAL roster, never by shape. `@` is an ordinary
 * character in prose, and 「联系我 @公司邮箱」 is not a roll-call.
 *
 * Mentions count ANYWHERE in the sentence, which is 1.x's rule
 * (`text.includes("@" + displayName)`) and had been narrowed here to the
 * leading run only. The narrowing was defended as disambiguation — 「问一下
 * @架构 和运维」 might mention a seat as a topic — but the cost was silent and
 * far worse than the case it guarded: 「请 @水户洋平 复核」 looks addressed to
 * one person and was quietly broadcast to everyone, with nothing on screen
 * saying so. A rule people cannot see is a rule that is wrong.
 *
 * What stays narrow is the STRIPPING. Only a leading roll-call is removed
 * from the instruction, because that is the part that is pure addressing; an
 * `@name` inside a sentence is part of the sentence and cutting it out would
 * hand the seat a mangled question.
