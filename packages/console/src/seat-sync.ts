/**
 * seat-sync.ts — carrying an edited agent into the teams already using it.
 *
 * A team's seats are COPIED from the agent library when the team is built.
 * That copy is what a round dispatches on, so editing the agent afterwards
 * changed the library and nothing else: the team kept its old backend, its
 * old connection, its old standing instructions. Every surface showed the new
 * values — the library page, the agent test — while the team ran the old
 * ones. 「改了老成员的属性，感觉都没有更新」 is that, and it is the same
 * shape as every other bug this project keeps finding: stored, rendered,
 * ignored.
 *
 * 1.x had this file (`team-agent-sync.ts`) and its comment named the exact
 * failure: a seat switched from Claude Code to DSH kept running `claude`
 * against an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and the CLI answered "There's an
 * issue with the selected model" — a message pointing nowhere near the cause.
 *
 * What is NOT synced is as deliberate as what is: `seatId` (the team's own
 * identity for the chair), `isSecretary` (a decision about this team, not
 * about the agent), and `color` when the seat has one (a team may want two
 * seats from one template told apart). Everything that decides how a seat is
 * DISPATCHED follows the template.

 * The seat shape these rules touch, declared here rather than imported.

 * real `SeatSpec` satisfies it by shape.
