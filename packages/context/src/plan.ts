/**
 * plan.ts — what one fold covers, and what it is given to work from.
 *
 * Three decisions live here, and 1.x got each of them wrong at least once:
 *
 *   The boundary is the LAST ENTRY THAT EXISTS WHEN THE FOLD STARTS, named up
 *   front. The secretary writes without stopping the team, so rounds land
 *   while it works and are recorded before the checkpoint is stored. If the
 *   window were later cut at the checkpoint's position instead, those turns —
 *   which the checkpoint never saw — would be cut away with nothing standing
 *   in for them.
 *
 *   The input is EVERYTHING SINCE THE LAST CHECKPOINT, not the window. They
 *   differ, and taking the window would feed each checkpoint the previous
 *   checkpoint's own output, compounding its losses once per fold.
 *
 *   The previous checkpoint is passed AS INPUT, not re-summarised. Settled
 *   items are inherited verbatim; re-condensing a condensed document loses a
 *   little more of it every time.
