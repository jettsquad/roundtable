/**
 * merge.ts — rejoining a team record that lives in two places.
 *
 * Speech is in the host session log; checkpoints are in the `squad_teams`
 * storage domain, because dsh's persistence read path refuses out-of-repo
 * event types (see domain.ts). Splitting the record was the price of not
 * losing it, and this is where the price is paid back.
 *
 * Kept pure and kept alone: it is the only place that knows the record has
 * two homes, so if dsh ever opens the event registration surface this one
 * function is what changes. It is also the only genuinely new logic in this
 * plugin — the two assembly layers were proven in 1.x — which is why it is
 * testable without a running harness.

 * to cover turns it never saw, and the window would drop them with nothing
 * standing in for them.
 *
 * A revoked checkpoint travels WITH its revocation marker rather than being
 * dropped here. Revocation semantics live in `window.ts`, which is tested for
 * them; a second place deciding the same thing is how two answers start to
 * disagree — and the one that would win here is the untested one.
 *
 * A checkpoint whose `coversUpTo` names no entry in the log is NOT silently
 * discarded: it leads the stream. Dropping it would cut history at a boundary
 * the seats never see the replacement for, which is the exact 1.x failure this
 * plugin exists to prevent. Leading the stream is the conservative reading —
 * it covers everything the log still holds.
