 * turns keep landing while it is being written and end up recorded BEFORE
 * it; those turns are not in it. Slicing at its position would drop them
 * with nothing standing in for them. `coversUpTo` names the last turn it

 * CLI holding its own copy cannot be told to forget; the table therefore
 * discards every seat's conversation when a fold happens, so a seat with a
 * live conversation is by construction a seat whose history has not been
 * rewritten since it last spoke. If that rule ever changes, this becomes
