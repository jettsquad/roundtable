/**
 * audit.ts — what happened to this team, in order, on disk.
 *
 * 1.x kept an `audit.log` beside the transcript: state transitions,
 * confirmations, terminations. 2.0 had `logger.warn`, which is a stream that
 * scrolls past and is gone — so 「谁把这个议程确认了、什么时候、跑的是哪一
 * 份」 could only be answered by whoever happened to be watching.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the transcript. The transcript is what the team said and
 * what the seats read; putting decisions in it would spend context on
 * bookkeeping and let a model's window fill with our own record-keeping. The
 * two answer different questions: the transcript answers "what was said", the
 * audit answers "what was decided, and to what".
 *
 * Bounded on purpose. An unbounded log in a JSON storage domain is a file
 * that grows until something else breaks, and the entries that matter are the
 * recent ones — a team's audit is read when something has just gone wrong.
