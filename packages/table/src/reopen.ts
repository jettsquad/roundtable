/**
 * reopen.ts — when continuing a seat's own conversation stops being worth it.
 *
 * Continuing is the cheap path only while two things hold, and both were
 * measured on a real seat before this existed:
 *
 * - The provider's prompt cache is still warm. It lasts an hour here — calls
 *   21 and 27 minutes apart were served from cache, calls 4 to 8 hours apart
 *   re-wrote the WHOLE context at the cache-write rate, which is dearer than
 *   plain input: 642k tokens re-written in one go after an overnight gap.
 * - The context is still small. Every model call re-reads all of it, and a
 *   seat doing firmware work makes a call per tool use — 476 calls in one
 *   conversation, the last ones reading ~800k each, 218M cache-read tokens in
 *   total, most of the conversation's cost.
 *
 * Past either line, a fresh conversation built from the newest checkpoint and
 * the discussion after it costs a fraction of one more resumed call.
 *
 * Arithmetic only. Nothing here asks a model anything.
