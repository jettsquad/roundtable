 * The model's reply is JSON it wrote, so it is treated as hostile input all
 * the way through: prose around the object is tolerated, the schema is
 * strict, and the roster check runs afterwards because the shape being legal

    'Give a phase a "check" whenever it must DELIVER something that can be verified by a command: files exist, a commit is in git log, tests or a script exit 0. "check.command" is ONE shell command run in the project folder by the app itself after the phase\'s tasks; exit code 0 means the phase passed, anything else sends the same seats back with the output (up to "maxAttempts" tries, default 3). Take the command from what the host or the plan already states as the exit criterion (e.g. the plan says "scripts/rb-exit.sh RB1 --commit exits 0" or "the commit feat(x): RB1 批次完成 exists" → check that). Never invent a criterion the plan does not state, and never write a check that cannot fail (e.g. "true", "echo ok", "|| true"). A search whose result nobody tests also cannot fail: `git log --grep=X` exits 0 when nothing matches, so write `git log --grep=X | grep -q .`. The app refuses a draft whose check it can see cannot fail. A check on a file the phase must produce has to test its CONTENT, not just that the file exists: `ls` or `wc -m` alone pass for a one-line stub or a status note. Assert something only the real deliverable has (a size floor with `test "$(wc -m < f)" -gt N`, a required heading or marker with `grep -q`, a value the plan names). Omit "check" for phases that are pure discussion or review with nothing a command can verify.',
    'A phase runs only after every phase it depends on has PASSED. By default it depends on the phase written just before it. Use "id" (short, unique) and "needs" (ids of EARLIER phases only) when that is not the real dependency — e.g. two phases that both depend on the same earlier one. Do not put "confirm the previous batch is committed before starting" into an instruction: the app enforces that through "needs" and the earlier phase\'s "check".',
    'Rules: use only the seatIds listed below; every phase needs at least one task; a phase that repeats rounds uses exit "after-bounded-rounds" WITH a positive integer maxRounds, and no other phase may set maxRounds.',
    'Set "artifactPath" ONLY when the host explicitly asks for that task\'s answer to be written to a file, and only with a path they actually name (relative to the project folder, e.g. "docs/review.md"). Never invent one: the app writes the file itself, so a made-up path sends later turns to a file that does not exist. Omit it otherwise. The app writes the seat\'s REPLY into that file, so use it only when the reply itself is the document. When the instruction tells the seat to save or write a file with its own tools (「保存成 md 文件」「写入某路径」), leave "artifactPath" out: otherwise the app overwrites the file the seat just wrote with the seat\'s short report about it.',
    'When one seat has to respond to, or keep a record of, what other seats said (a review round answered by a writer, minutes of a discussion), give the OTHER seats\' tasks an "artifactPath" so the app writes their replies to files, and tell the responding seat to read those files. Never instruct a seat to copy another seat\'s long reply verbatim into a file: that is slow, error-prone, and a long verbatim copy was refused by the model service\'s safety classifier three times in a row. Set "contextMode" to "independent" when the host wants each member to answer without seeing the others (e.g. 各自独立评审); otherwise "cumulative".',
    // Labelling the phase is not extra work asked of the model — deciding
    // what a phase is FOR is what drafting it already consists of. Naming it
    // is what lets the host's own criteria be consulted when the phase opens,
    // instead of only when somebody remembers to ask.
    `Set "situation" to describe what KIND of decision the phase makes. "action" is exactly one of: ${ACTION_KINDS.join(", ")}. "features" are properties of the thing being decided about, zero or more of: ${FEATURE_FLAGS.join(", ")}. Both lists are CLOSED — never invent a value; omit "situation" entirely if none of them fit.`,
