/**
 * assist.ts — the secretary doing a job for the host, off the record.
 *
 * 1.x had this and 2.0 did not, which is most of what 「秘书没有协调、组织
 * 其它 agent 的能力」 names. The agenda path was here from the start, but it
 * only answers one question — 「把这句话拆成阶段」. Everything else a
 * secretary is for (总结到这里为止的讨论、把分歧列出来、谁还欠什么、按这些
 * 结论重排一下分工) had nowhere to go.
 *
 * Two properties make this a secretary task rather than another seat's turn,
 * and both come straight from 1.x:
 *
 *  - **Private-blind.** It sees the public discussion and nothing else. The
 *    host's own materials are not in the prompt, so an answer can never quote
 *    something the team has not seen.
 *  - **Not a discussant.** The answer is a DRAFT for the host. It is not
 *    recorded as a turn, so nobody else's next round inherits it as
 *    something the team said. A summary written by a secretary and a claim
 *    made by a member are different kinds of thing, and a record that
 *    conflates them cannot be read afterwards.
 *
 * The discussion is data, never instructions — said explicitly in the prompt,
 * because the text being summarised is written by models and would otherwise
 * be a place to hide an order.
