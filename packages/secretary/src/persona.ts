/**
 * persona.ts — giving a seat its standing instructions when the seam cannot.
 *
 * `SubagentStartRequest.persona` is a CAPABILITY, and only the Claude Code
 * backend declares it. Codex and dsh declare `persona: false` truthfully —
 * `codex exec` and `dsh --profile headless` take a task and nothing else —
 * and the seam then REFUSES a request carrying one rather than accepting it
 * and quietly dropping it. That refusal is correct and it is the reason this
 * file exists: every secretary task passed the seat's system prompt as
 * `persona`, so a team whose secretary ran on dsh or codex could not draft an
 * agenda, write a checkpoint, or do anything else at all. The error named a
 * capability, which reads as an internal detail, so from the outside the
 * secretary simply had no abilities.
 *
 * The fix is not to drop the persona — the standing instructions are half of
 * why that seat was chosen as secretary. It is to put them where a prompt-only
 * backend can still read them: at the top of the prompt, labelled, so the
 * model can tell its own standing instructions from the job at hand.
