/**
 * store.ts — a directory of plain text, and why it is not a database.
 *
 * The requirement is blunt: one directory, plain text files, manageable with
 * git, readable after Squad is gone. This is the user's own asset — the
 * design calls it worth more than any single project — so it must survive a
 * new machine, a reinstall, and this project being abandoned. A record only
 * readable through the tool that wrote it fails that on the first of those.
 *
 * The layout carries the export boundary rather than restating it:
 *
 *   criteria/   abstracts   — transferable, may be given away or shared
 *   instances/  occurrences — the user's own, with project detail, never leave
 *   proposals/  awaiting the human's verdict
 *
 * "Abstract exportable, instance not" is then a fact about which directory a
 * file is in, not a rule some future export routine has to remember. One
 * decision doing two jobs, which is why nothing here needs a privacy flag.
