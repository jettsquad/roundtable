/**
 * deliver.ts — choosing which criteria to surface, and how they read.
 *
 * Two hard limits, and both are structural rather than advisory.
 *
 * At most THREE. A criteria library that grows without a delivery budget
 * ends up prefacing every decision with everything it has ever learned,
 * which is how a set of judgements becomes noise that gets skipped. The cap
 * is applied here, where the list is produced, not left to whoever renders
 * it.
 *
 * And nothing here formats anything for a discussion seat. Criteria go to
 * the host side and the secretary only — they shape how work is organised
 * and judged, never how a participant thinks. That separation is this
 * system's main defence against becoming an echo chamber, and it is enforced
 * by topology: these strings are returned to the caller and never handed to
 * the table, so there is no path along which they could reach a seat's
 * prompt. A rule someone has to keep obeying would not survive a year.

/**
 * Coarse filter: could this criterion bear on this situation?
 *
 * COULD, not DOES. Features only have to overlap, not to be contained — and
 * that is a correction, made against evidence rather than taste.
 *
 * It was written as a conjunction first, matching how a criterion reads
 * (「特征 ⊇ {自动触发, 结果不可见}」). Then a criterion learned from
 * designing an auto-fold mechanism failed to fire on a phase labelled
 * "design an auto-fold mechanism": the distillation had filed it under
 * {automatic, invisible-result} and the secretary had labelled the phase
 * {automatic, changes-default}. Both labels are defensible. Two independent
 * model calls picking from a closed list with no shared anchor will disagree
 * like this, and no amount of prompt tuning on either side removes it.
 *
 * The asymmetry decides it. Over-fetching is recoverable — the selection step
 * reads the claim and the boundary and drops what does not apply, and a hard
 * cap of three stands behind that. Under-fetching is not: the criterion is
 * never seen by anything that could judge it, which is the design's own first
 * failure mode ("never recalled → the trigger is wrong"). A coarse filter
 * that demands exact agreement is not coarse.
