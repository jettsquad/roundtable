/**
 * decontextualise.ts — is this an abstract, or an instance wearing its coat?
 *
 * The design's own example, from a real bug:
 *
 *   NOT decontextualised (still an instance):
 *     "在 Squad 的 electron-entry.ts 里改 applyTeamConfig 时不要调
 *      teamRegistry.get()，它会触发 rehydrate 导致递归"
 *
 *   Decontextualised (now an abstract):
 *     "一个会被惰性重建路径调用的函数，内部不能再调用那条重建路径的入口
 *      —— 入口通常带着「没有就建一个」的语义。这种位置要用只读不重建的访问器。"
 *
 * The second holds for any system with lazy initialisation and has nothing to
 * do with Squad, Electron or TypeScript. That difference is the whole point,
 * and §7.4 turns it into something executable:
 *
 *   > A claim that stops holding once its context is stripped was never an
 *   > abstract — it is an instance that got mistaken for one.
 *
 * Which gives the distillation step a real test instead of asking a model
 * whether something "feels general enough".
 *
 * The line between what a machine can catch and what it cannot is drawn
 * honestly here. File paths, identifiers, URLs and names the caller supplies
 * are structural and catchable. A domain assumption buried in the phrasing is
 * not — the corrected example above still presumes lazy rebuilding exists —
 * and pretending otherwise would turn "passed the check" into a claim the
 * check cannot support.
