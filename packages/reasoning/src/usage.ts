/**
 * usage.ts — the three scales a criterion is checked against.
 *
 * A criteria library with no self-correction becomes a set of slogans that
 * nobody can tell are wrong. These are the checks:
 *
 *   DELIVERED  — relevance. Never recalled means the trigger is wrong, not
 *                that the claim is unpopular.
 *   OUTCOME    — effectiveness. Delivered for months and never changing a
 *                decision means it is decoration.
 *   COUNTER    — truthfulness. Lots of evidence and NEVER a counter-example
 *                is the suspicious case, not the reassuring one: either the
 *                claim is too vague to contradict, or nobody is testing it.
 *
 * Two of these the program can count exactly. The third it cannot — whether a
 * decision changed BECAUSE of a criterion is not visible from here — so it is
 * a mark the human leaves, not an inference. Inventing a proxy for it would
 * produce a number that looks like measurement and is not.
 *
 * Usage stays on the local side of the export boundary, with instances. Given
 * someone else's abstract, you should not receive their delivery counts;
 * given yours away, you should not hand over how you have been working.
