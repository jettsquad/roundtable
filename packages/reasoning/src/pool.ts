/**
 * pool.ts — sharing abstracts, and the two things sharing must not become.
 *
 * NOT A SYNC, AND NOT A REPLACEMENT. An abstract arriving from the pool is a
 * CANDIDATE; whether it enters this library is decided by the owner's own
 * instances. So an import lands in `proposals/` — the same queue a locally
 * distilled proposal waits in — and is adopted one at a time or not at all.
 *
 * That routing is also the answer to averaging, which is the real risk here.
 * A pool whose default is everyone's consensus produces a mediocre middle,
 * and this framework's value is precisely that it takes positions —
 * evidence first, gates, independent answers are choices, not consensus.
 * Consensus files the edges off. Per-item opt-in keeps them, and it is
 * enforced by there being no code path from an import to an active criterion.
 *
 * What travels: trigger, claim, boundary, and aggregate support. What does
 * not: instances, project detail, transcripts, anybody's history. The export
 * boundary was already the directory split; this reuses it rather than
 * inventing a second rule that could disagree with the first.
