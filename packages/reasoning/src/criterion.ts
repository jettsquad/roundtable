/**
 * criterion.ts — a criterion, an instance, and the Markdown they live in.
 *
 * Structure gets it FOUND, prose gets it UNDERSTOOD, and neither alone works.
 * Pure prose cannot be filtered without reading everything through a model
 * each time; pure structure flattens the "why", and the why is the only part
 * of a criterion worth anything. So: a structured trigger decides whether to
 * fetch it, and natural language decides what to do with it once fetched.
 *
 * The same split is already proven at small scale — the context checkpoint's
 * four fixed headings are structure the assembler reads without parsing
 * prose, and its body is judgement. This is that, larger.
 *
 * The abstract/instance split is also the export boundary, which is why they
 * are separate files in separate directories rather than sections of one:
 * abstracts are transferable and may be given away, instances carry the
 * user's own project detail and never leave. One decision, not two.
