/**
 * situation.ts — the key a criterion is found by.
 *
 * The whole system turns on one decision: the key is the SITUATION, not the
 * text. 「不可见 = 不可纠正」 was learned from checkpoint folding and should
 * fire on automatic retry and automatic degradation — wording nothing alike,
 * situation identical. Text similarity never finds that; the situation finds
 * it first time. And that is the recall worth having: a same-topic reminder
 * is something the user would have thought of anyway, a cross-topic one only
 * the system can offer.
 *
 * Both lists are CLOSED, at 7 and 8. Extending either is a deliberate human
 * act, not something the system may do to itself while running — an open
 * vocabulary drifts, and a key that drifts stops matching what was filed
 * under it. Better to be short of labels at first than to lose the index.
