/**
 * sessions.ts — which CLI conversation each seat is currently in.
 *
 * A side channel, and it exists because the seam has no room for this. A
 * provider's `start` receives a `SubagentStartRequest` whose fields are fixed
 * by dsh — label, prompt, parent, signal, tool filter, persona — and none of
 * them can carry "continue conversation X". Smuggling one through as an extra
 * property would depend on the request object surviving unchanged all the way
 * to the provider, which is not something the seam promises.
 *
 * So the table writes here and the backends read here, keyed by the two things
 * a provider CAN see: the parent session and the seat's label. That pair is
 * also exactly the isolation wanted — the same agent sitting in two teams, or
 * in two sittings of one team, is two conversations, and neither can be handed
 * the other's history.
 *
 * Module state and plain functions, following `activity.ts` next door: the
 * writer and the readers are in different packages that must not import each
 * other, and both already depend on this one.
 *
 * Persisted by the table (`snapshotSeatSessions` / `restoreSeatSessions`), so
 * a restart does not force every seat to open fresh. A stale id is recovered
 * the way it always was: `resumeWasRejected`, forget, retry fresh.
 *
 * Each entry also carries WHEN the conversation was last used and HOW BIG its
 * context had grown. Neither is needed to resume; both are needed to decide
 * whether resuming is worth it — see `@squad/table`'s `reopenReason`.
