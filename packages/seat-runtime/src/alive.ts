/**
 * alive.ts — the liveness channel, and keeping it out of the failure channel.
 *
 * The watchdog decides a seat is gone by watching its output stop. That works
 * for a CLI that writes as it goes and fails completely for one that does
 * not: `dsh --profile headless` awaits the whole turn and then writes the
 * answer in a single `stdout.write`, so its byte count is ZERO however well
 * it is going. Measured, not assumed — a probe plugin in a real child showed
 * `assistant/chunk` arriving every 1.6s inside a process whose stdout had not
 * moved at all.
 *
 * Rather than lengthen the deadline — which only makes a person wait longer
 * without telling them anything — that backend now SAYS it is alive: a plugin
 * in the child writes one marked line to stderr as the model produces tokens
 * and as tools run. The signal is real work, never a timer: a timer would
 * keep a wedged process alive forever, which is worse than the bug it fixed.
 *
 * Marked, because stderr is already the FAILURE channel. `readStderrTail`
 * shows its last few lines as the reason a seat failed, and unmarked
 * heartbeats would push the real error — 「MISSING_CREDENTIAL: …」 — out of
 * that window and, past the 256 KB collection cap, off the buffer entirely.
 * So every heartbeat carries this prefix and every reader drops it.
 */

/**
 * What a heartbeat line starts with.
 *
 * The child writes it from its own copy of this literal — importing this

 * in with it — and a test asserts the two are the same string.
