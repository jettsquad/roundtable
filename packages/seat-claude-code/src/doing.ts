/**
 * doing.ts — what a Claude Code seat has started and not finished.
 *
 * Read off the stream the CLI already writes, event by event. Every shape
 * here was captured from a live `claude -p --output-format stream-json` run
 * (2.1.295) rather than taken from documentation:
 *
 *   assistant  … tool_use {id, name, input}        a tool call begins
 *   user       … tool_result {tool_use_id}         that call returned
 *   system     task_started {task_id, tool_use_id, is_backgrounded}
 *   system     task_notification {task_id, status} a task ended
 *   system     task_updated {task_id, patch.status}
 *   system     background_tasks_changed {tasks}    the whole list, restated
 *
 * The background events are the reason this exists. A command run in the
 * background RETURNS at once — its tool call closes within a second — and the
 * turn then waits on it without writing another byte. Counting bytes, that is
 * indistinguishable from a seat that has gone: a full test suite was
 * cancelled as wedged at fifteen minutes, twice, taking the suite with it.
 * The stream had said the whole time that a task was still open.
