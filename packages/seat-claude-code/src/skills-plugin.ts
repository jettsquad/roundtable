/**
 * skills-plugin.ts — the shared skills folder, as something an isolated
 * Claude Code seat can be handed.
 *
 * Skills are installed ONCE, in `~/.agents/skills` — the cross-tool location
 * dsh scans natively and Codex reads too. A Claude Code seat cannot be
 * pointed at it directly: the only way in for a seat started without the
 * host's own configuration is `--plugin-dir`, and a plugin is a folder with
 * a manifest and a `skills/` directory. So this builds that folder, with
 * `skills/` a link to the shared one.
 *
 * A link rather than a copy, so a skill added or edited in the shared folder
 * is what the next seat sees, with nothing to re-run.
 *
 * Only the catalogue reaches the seat's context — each skill's name and its
 * one-line description. A body is read when the seat decides to use it. That
 * is the difference from pasting a skill into a prompt block, which grows
 * every seat's prompt by every skill whether it is used or not.
