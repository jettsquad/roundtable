/**
 * argv.ts — the command line, and the fence the stock provider cannot build.
 *
 * The reason this package exists. `@deepseek-ai/dsh-subagent-claude-code`
 * hardcodes `disallowedTools: ['AskUserQuestion']` and exposes no way to add
 * to it: its config carries `env` and `disposeGraceMs` and nothing else. So a
 * secretary asked to draft an agenda can spawn its own subagents to do the
 * work instead — which is exactly what happened in 1.x, where a secretary
 * that did not know the roster invented a team of its own.
 *
 * 1.x's executor does not fix that either. It builds
 *
 *     claude -p <prompt> --output-format stream-json --verbose
 *            --include-partial-messages --permission-mode <mode>
 *
 * with no tool restriction at all — it is the cause, not the cure. What IS
 * worth carrying from it is everything else: stream-json for real activity,
 * partial messages so a long silence is distinguishable from a wedged
 * process, and the permission-mode mapping.
 *
 * Verified before building on it: `claude -p … --disallowed-tools Task`
 * answers "当前环境没有可供派生子 agent 执行一次性任务的 Task 工具，所以我
 * 直接用只读命令完成了这个任务". Structurally blocked, not asked nicely.
