/**
 * team-plan.ts — the shape of a team somebody proposed building.
 *
 * Here rather than in a plugin for the same reason `agenda.ts` is here, and
 * it is the only reason that earns a place in this package: it genuinely has
 * two consumers on opposite sides of the plugin wall. ③ the secretary
 * PROPOSES one from a discussion; the console INSTANTIATES one the host
 * confirmed, into agent templates and a roster. Neither may import the other.
 *
 * The problem it exists for is that a MISSING SEAT does not announce itself.
 * A team built to write articles that has nobody answering "will this pass
 * the platform's rules" runs perfectly: every round succeeds, every seat
 * answers, and the output is quietly always short of publishable. That is the
 * same family as a checkpoint missing its 「未决分歧」 section — the failure
 * reads as an absence of content rather than as a fault.
 *
 * So nothing here trusts the producer. The schema is strict (unknown keys
 * rejected, not ignored — a key the model invented is an instruction it
 * believes it gave us), and the checks a schema cannot make run separately in
 * `checkTeamPlan`.
