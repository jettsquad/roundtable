/**
 * speakable.ts — turning a seat's reply into something worth hearing.
 *
 * Reading a reply aloud verbatim does not work, and the reasons are all
 * structural rather than cosmetic. A seat's answer is written to be SCANNED:
 * headings you skip past, a table you read down one column of, a code block
 * you look at only if the prose above made you care. Speech is linear — you
 * cannot skim it — so every one of those becomes a minute of listening to
 * punctuation being pronounced.
 *
 * So this is not a Markdown renderer with the tags removed. It decides what
 * survives contact with an ear: prose survives, structure is announced rather
 * than spelled out, and code is named rather than read. 「这里有一段代码」 is
 * more use than forty seconds of `const`, and the text is still on screen for
 * anyone who wants the real thing.
