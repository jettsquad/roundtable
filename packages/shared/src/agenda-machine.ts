/**
 * agenda-machine.ts — what an agenda does next.
 *
 * An agenda used to be a list walked once: each phase ran, its seats
 * answered, and it was done. "Done" meant "somebody replied". So a batch
 * whose exit script failed left five later phases to run anyway, each seat
 * answering 「前置提交不存在，不开工」, and the whole thing recorded as
 * finished — after which it sat for eight hours.
 *
 * Here it is a small state machine instead. A node passes when Squad's own
 * check says so, is retried with the check's output when it does not, and
 * reaches a DECISION POINT when retrying has stopped helping. Nodes that wait
 * on one that did not pass are never run at all.
 *
 * Pure, on purpose. Every rule below is a function of the agenda and the
 * nodes' recorded states; nothing here starts a seat, runs a command or reads
 * a clock. That is what lets the rules be tested one at a time — the loop
 * this replaces had no test at all, because it could only be exercised by
 * running real seats.
