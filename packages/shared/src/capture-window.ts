/**
 * capture-window.ts — which lines a marked utterance is judged against.
 *
 * `capture` wants a PAIR: what the machine proposed, and what the human made
 * of it. A button on one message supplies only the second half, and the first
 * half is what decides whether a criterion comes out as a standard or as a
 * free-floating opinion — so the window that supplies it is the whole design
 * here, not plumbing.
 *
 * The rule is the host's, and it is sharper than "the message and some
 * context":
 *
 *   - Normally, everything the seats said between the host's PREVIOUS message
 *     and this one. That is exactly the material this utterance is a verdict
 *     on; anything earlier belongs to a decision already made.
 *   - When the utterance names seats with `@`, only those seats' replies in
 *     that window. Pointing at someone is saying which reply this answers,
 *     and it is the one case where the pairing is stated rather than inferred.
 *   - When no seat spoke in between, the pair has no first half, and that is
 *     kept rather than refused: a person who says two things in a row may be
 *     laying down a standard outright rather than overruling anyone.
