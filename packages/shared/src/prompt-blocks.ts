/**
 * prompt-blocks.ts — the middle tier of a seat's prompt.
 *
 * A seat used to read exactly two things: whatever its own prompt said, and
 * whatever the round carried. So anything true of SEVERAL seats had to be
 * copied into each of them, and copies drift — an edit lands on four of five
 * and the fifth goes on working from the old rule. Silently, because a seat
 * with stale standing instructions answers confidently rather than failing.
 *
 * Three tiers now: what the whole table reads, what a NAMED GROUP of seats
 * reads, and what this seat alone reads. The middle one is the part that
 * needed a shape, and the shape it needed is not a group of seats — it is a
 * SET: some blocks, some seats, a name. Membership overlaps in practice (the
 * seats that write share a method; the seats that publish share a compliance
 * rule; one seat does both), and overlapping subsets are what a list of sets
 * expresses naturally and a partition does not.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. Which blocks a seat reads, in what order, with
 * what removed, is the part that decides behaviour, and it should be
 * decidable in a test rather than by reading a prompt in a browser.

 * The blocks one seat reads, in order, deduplicated.

 * the frame, what this group of seats does is inside it, and what this seat
 * does is inside that. Read the other way round, a seat treats the shared
 * rules as commentary on its own job.
 *
 * DEDUPLICATED, first occurrence wins. A block reachable through two sets —
 * the same self-check listed by 「产出型席位」 and by 「对外交付」 — would
 * otherwise be printed twice, and a model reading one instruction twice does
 * not conclude it was configured twice; it concludes the instruction matters
 * more than the ones around it.
 *
 * Ids that name nothing are skipped rather than throwing. This runs on every
 * turn of every seat, and a block deleted from the library must not be able
 * to stop a round — the missing text is visible in the composed prompt, which
 * is where a person is looking when they ask why a seat changed.
