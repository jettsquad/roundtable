/**
 * agent-reply-text.ts — a reply is what the agent said, not how it got there.
 *
 * Several backends emit their reasoning inline: DeepSeek-lineage models wrap
 * it in `<think>` tags and the harness hands us stdout verbatim, and any
 * model reached through the plain-completion fallback can do the same. That
 * text then became a transcript message — read by the host, carried into
 * every later turn's context, and folded into checkpoints.
 *
 * It is stripped rather than shown. Reasoning is long, it is the model
 * talking to itself, and it crowds out the answer for every reader
 * downstream — human and agent alike.
 *
 * Claude Code and Codex are already clean by construction (their stream
 * parsers keep only text / agent_message blocks), so this exists for the
 * harnesses that hand back raw text.
