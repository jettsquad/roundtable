 * is laid out, the conventions and vocabulary it uses. Not a seat's persona
 * and not a way of working — those are the agent's own standing instructions,
 * which Squad already owns and which would drift here into something no
 * screen in Squad can show.
 *
 * The list is deliberately partial. `dsh` has no such convention, and giving
 * it one Squad invented would be a file nothing reads.
