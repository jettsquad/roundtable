/**
 * model-json.ts — getting a JSON object out of something a model said.
 *
 * Two callers ask for the same thing from opposite sides of the plugin wall:
 * ③ the secretary parsing an agenda reply, and the console parsing a team
 * plan. They had one copy between them; a second would drift, and the two
 * halves of a drifted tolerance are 「这份好好的方案被拒了」 on one screen and
 * 「这份坏方案被收了」 on the other.
 *
 * Tolerant only up to the object boundary. The failure being avoided is a
 * perfectly good answer refused because the model wrote 「给你：」 first, or
 * wrapped it in a code fence. What is INSIDE still faces a strict schema —
 * tolerance about packaging is not tolerance about content.
