/**
 * agenda-identity.ts — which agenda this is, and proving it later.
 *
 * Two problems, one file, because they are the same question asked at two
 * moments.
 *
 * BEFORE confirmation: is the plan I am confirming still the plan I was
 * shown? A draft lives in one slot; a second panel, a re-drafted agenda, or a
 * stale tab can replace it between the render and the click. 1.x answered
 * this with `teamAgendaId` + `revision` + `status` and refused anything that
 * did not line up. Without it the last writer wins and nobody is told.
 *
 * AFTER it: is the plan that RAN the plan I confirmed? 1.x hashed the
 * canonical draft into `teamConfirmationHash`. The hash is not a security
 * boundary — the host is the authority here and may edit freely — it is an
 * audit fact: months later the record can still answer "was this what you
 * approved" without anyone having to remember.
 *
 * Canonicalisation is the load-bearing part of both. Two objects that mean
 * the same agenda must produce the same bytes, or the hash records the shape
 * of a JSON serialiser rather than the content of a plan.
