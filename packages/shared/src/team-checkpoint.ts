/**
 * team-checkpoint.ts — the context checkpoint: a navigation document.
 *
 * A checkpoint is NOT the same thing as a summary the host asks an agent
 * for. That is a work product: it lands in the transcript as an ordinary
 * reply and changes nothing about what later turns are shown. A checkpoint
 * is a control artifact: once recorded, earlier turns stop being carried
 * into context. The two are kept apart by event kind so neither can be
 * mistaken for the other.
 *
 * It navigates rather than compresses. Replies are not squeezed into a
 * shorter retelling — the checkpoint states what was decided, what is still
 * open, and where the detail lives, so a later turn can go read the
 * original when it needs it. Compression loses; an index does not.
 *
 * Disagreement is first-class. Flattening three positions into "the team
 * decided X" destroys the minority views permanently, and nobody
 * downstream can tell it happened. Open disagreements stay listed, and
 * each new checkpoint re-adjudicates them: settled ones close, live ones
 * carry, new ones join.

const INSTRUCTIONS = `你在为一个 AI 协作团队写「上下文检查点」。它不是给人看的汇报，而是后续 agent 唯一能看到的历史。

写作要求：
- 严格使用下列四个标题，顺序不变，不要增删标题。
- 已定事项：写结论，不写过程。每条独立成立，读者没有上下文也能懂。
- 未决分歧：**不要把分歧写成共识**。有几种立场就列几种，注明各自是谁、理由是什么。这是本文档最重要的部分。
- 产出索引：只列下方「已写入的文件」中给出的路径，**不要自己编造路径**。每条附一句话说明里面写了什么，好让后续 agent 不打开文件也能判断要不要读。没有文件就写「无」。
- 不要复述原文，不要写客套话，不要评价团队表现。`;

const CONTINUATION_INSTRUCTIONS = `这是一次**接续**检查点，上一份检查点在下方。

- 已定事项：直接继承上一份的条目（它们已经是结论，不要重新概括，否则每次都会再失真一层），再并入这期间新达成的。
- 未决分歧：**逐条重新裁定**上一份列出的分歧 —— 已解决的移出并写进「已定事项」，仍未决的保留，新出现的加入。它是一份活的清单，不是流水账。
- 当前目标：如果主持人后来改了方向，以最新为准。`;
