/**
 * agent-check.ts — what a configuration test can honestly report.
 *
 * Four separate answers rather than one verdict, because they fail for
 * unrelated reasons and each one has a different fix: the CLI is not
 * installed, the seat backend for that CLI was never built, the key is
 * missing, the endpoint is unreachable. A single 「测试失败」 sends a person
 * looking in the wrong place three times out of four.
 *
 * Every check reports `skipped` as its own outcome, never as a pass. A check
 * that could not run and a check that passed look identical in a green tick,
 * and only one of them is evidence.
 */

/**
 * What one check concluded.
 *
 * `skipped` and `unknown` are different answers and were briefly the same
 * one, which is how a fully configured subscription agent came back as
 * ⚠️「有检查没跑成」 with every applicable check green:
 *
 *   skipped — there was nothing to check. A subscription seat needs no key; a
 *             connection with no endpoint uses the backend's default. That is
 *             a COMPLETE answer, not a gap.
 *   unknown — we wanted to check and could not. That is missing evidence, and
 *             it must not read as a pass.
