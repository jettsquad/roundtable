/**
 * reasoning-effort.ts — how hard a seat's model thinks, across three backends.
 *
 * One vocabulary for the person, three spellings on the wire — each verified
 * by capturing the request a real CLI sends, not by reading docs:
 *
 * - Claude Code: `--effort X` → `output_config.effort`. The same field
 *   MiniMax's Anthropic-compatible endpoint reads, and the CLI sends it for a
 *   non-Claude model name too. Left unset, the CLI sends `high` on its own —
 *   so a MiniMax seat whose server default is `max` has been running at
 *   `high` all along.
 * - Codex: `-c model_reasoning_effort="X"`, passed through unchecked; which
 *   levels exist is per model, and Codex's own model cache says which.
 * - dsh: through the seat's profile patch. The DeepSeek route takes
 *   `off/low/high/max`; any other model rides the OpenAI-compatible route,
 *   which sends no reasoning field at all unless the patch declares levels.
 *
 * The level travels on the seam's own field, `agentOptions.reasoningEffort`,
 * and each backend translates it. Nothing here knows those spellings.
