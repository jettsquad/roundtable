/**
 * patch.ts — telling a headless DSH which model to use.
 *
 * Without this, a DSH seat runs the stock `headless` profile, which routes to
 * DeepSeek's own endpoint. A connection's endpoint and model were stored,
 * shown in the library, and then ignored — so a MiniMax key was being sent to
 * DeepSeek's API and came back 「Authentication Fails」, blaming the key for a
 * request that had gone to the wrong company.
 *
 * 1.x got this right and the mechanism is carried over: write a one-shot
 * profile patch and pass `--patch`. Two shapes, because DSH routes DeepSeek's
 * own models through a dedicated provider and everything else through the
 * OpenAI-compatible one:
 *
 *   deepseek-*  → point `llm-deepseek` at the baseURL
 *   anything else → declare one provider on `llm-pi-ai`, which the base
 *                   bundle already mounts DORMANT (no routes until a profile
 *                   supplies entries). Configuring that instance rather than
 *                   adding a second matters: a second one re-declares pi-ai's
 *                   configurable providers and the whole tree refuses to load
 *                   with 「configurable provider … is already declared」.
 *
 * The KEY never enters the file — only the name of the variable carrying it.
 * The patch is a file on disk; a secret written there would outlive the run.
