/**
 * stream.ts — reading a headless DSH run back into one answer.
 *
 * `dsh --profile headless` prints the final assistant message as PLAIN TEXT
 * and exits: no envelope, no JSONL, and — in its own chunk switch — an
 * explicit `case "usage": return;`. The harness measures every model call and
 * the headless app throws the number away.
 *
 * So the accounting comes back on STDERR, written by the plugin Squad already
 * injects into the child for heartbeats. Not stdout, because stdout is the
 * answer: a marked line there would have to be stripped out of a person's
 * reply, and a stripper that ever misses corrupts the one thing this backend
 * exists to produce.
 *
 * Absent is still reported as absent. A child running an older harness, or one
 * killed before its first model call, has no figure — and a zero would read as
 * 「这一轮不花钱」, which is the reading that hid this gap in the first place.
