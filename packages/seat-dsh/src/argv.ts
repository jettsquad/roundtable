 * `dsh --profile headless "task"` is the documented one-shot entry point:

 * says exactly that, which is why this backend is a CLI seat like the other
 * two rather than something that reaches into the running harness.
 *
 * The profile is configurable because it is the whole configuration surface
 * here: which model a DSH seat runs on is decided by the profile's own model
 * settings, not by a flag this can pass. A deployment that wants a different
 * model for its seats composes a profile for them.
